    Once you get comfortable with functions you will use them everywhere! Becoming
    proficient with creating functions is crucial to your programming skills. 

    For this section we'll introduce a new Python module called random. This module
    creates a psuedo random number generator as well as some other useful functions. 
    The following questions will ask you to use this module:

        random.shuffle([list]) -> Randomizes the input list in place and returns nothing.
        random.randint(a,b) -> Return a number between a and b inclusive
'''
import random


'''
    1.  Write a function called myprint that takes no parameters and simply
        prints out any random string of your choosing. 

        Call the function. 
'''

'''
    2.  Write a function called sum that takes two parameters and returns the 
        sum (addition) of the two parameters.

        Call the function. 
'''

'''
    3.  Write a function called random_selection that takes a single parameter that
        is a list. The function should randomly choose a value from the list and return
        that value. 

        Call the function. 
'''
test_list = ["red", "white", "blue"]

'''
    4.  Write a function called random_shuffle that takes a single parameter that
        is an integer. 
        
        The function should create a list of numbers that has as many members in it 
        as defined by the single input parameter. 
        
        Return the shuffled list.

        Call the function. 
'''
test_list = ["red", "white", "blue"]

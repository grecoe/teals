"""
Card game of WAR

Uses several global variables to track card values but decks and players built
up during game execution.

There are 7 functions in total that allow the game play to be condensed into
a smaller logical unit towards the end of the file.

The actual game play is between lines 218 and 302 (and that's the short version).

Imagine how long that one loop would be if you tried to include ALL of the functionality
into a single giant loop and how confusing it would be if something went wrong!

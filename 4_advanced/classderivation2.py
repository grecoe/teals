'''
    Classes can derive from other classes to extend the functionality. While this works with any types of classes
    these examples extend the list ([]) and string (str) Python objects to return all of the indexes of a particular
    entry contained within them.

    Why write somethign like this? Because the index() function in python will only give us the FIRST index of a
    particular item in the sequence. What if you want the 2nd, 3rd or all of them? There is nothign baked into the language
    that supports that.

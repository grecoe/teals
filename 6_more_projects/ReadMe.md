## Simple Chat

Once a student starts to understand classes it's useful for them to practice using them. Using and not creating is the key here.

This program is a simple chat program that can be run from multiple command windows to simulate a chat program.

Very simple in that there is no validation, no network, etc.

It contains 5 classes for the student to use (with examples in the main.py file) to create the app.

The goal is for them to use these classes and create a basic program that allows a user to provide a name, see and send messages.

This is important because there will be a simulation of state. When a user is looking at the inbox, for example, but they want to see the whole message they must understand they are in the inbox.
